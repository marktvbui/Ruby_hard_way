Most Spring Rolls you order at restaurants are not meaty, and filled mostly with noodles, herbs, and lastly a thin slice of boiled pork, and half a shrimp. Tasty and fulfilling, but filled mostly with carbs. My version is the hungry man's version, filled with meat!!! i at least double the amount of meat in my spring rolls! nothing fancy or different than other traditional spring rolls, but these i serve as main courses, not appetizers :)

Ingredients:

<ol>
<li>3 lbs Shrimp</li>
<li>3 lbs your preferred meat, chicken for me</li>
<li>1 head of lettuce</li>
<li>1 cucumber</li>
<li>1 bunch of mints</li>
<li>1 bunch of cilantro</li>
<li>1 pack of rice noodles</li>
<li>1 pack of rice wrappers</li>
<li>your favorite spices</li> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcRfM46Q1ob3BdM9jLYCqMO_Xus3Qm2tiFvosCGM1ujgvme7CPU-yhaT9coHJ3MSv4oQWceRTNA&usqp=CAE">

<p>
First step, deshell the shrimp and set them aside.
Cut your meat to the same size as the shrimp, then season with your preferred spices, i normally use salt, pepper, and 5 spice seasoning. Let this sit until you are done prepping.
Prepare your lettuce by slicing it to thin strips, skin your cucumber and slice these into thin slices. wash mints and cilantros, and pull leaves off the stems.
cook noodles in boiling water per instructions on the wrapper.
after the prep work is done, cook the shrimp in boiling water and set these aside until your ready to roll up the spring rolls.
cook your meat until done, also set these aside.
bring all ingredients to a table for the next part!

<p>
submerge the rice wrappers in hot water until the wrapper softens, flatten out the wrapper on a big round plate, and add your ingredients. i normally use 3 whole shrimps as my size guide, so i first place 3 whole shrimps onto the wrapper, place some meat on top of that, then next to that, place some rice noodles. between the noodles and meat, place some lettuce, cucumber, mints and cilantro, then roll these up, with the noodles on the bottom, and shrimp on top.
done, time to eat!!! i like to eat the first one to ensure the quality is good, then keep rolling until all ingredients are used up. if there are left over ingredients no worries, can always make a nice rice noodle salad with left overs.
